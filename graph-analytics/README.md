# Graph analytics plugin

This plugin offers several recipes to handle two kinds of graphs:

 * Edges list (graph specified as a list of source_node / target_node couples)
 * Bipartite graph (two kinds of items like product and transaction, transactions linking products together)

It can transform bipartite graphs into edge lists and extract node statistics from both kinds
